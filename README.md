# Real Time Bus Tracker
This project demonstrates a map featuring markers to show you where bus stops are along a specific route.  The route featured here is from the MIT campus to the Harvard Campus

# Installation
These files can be downloaded from this GitHub repository in order to be used on your personal device.

# Usage
This project can be edited in any coding program.  It was originally created in VS Code.  It can then be loaded in any browser by dragging and dropping the file into the browser (Chrome is recommended).  You can update the map locations to any place of your choosing by updating the Longitude and Latitude coordinates in the JavaScript File.  You will also need a Personal Access Token in order for your map to work.  You can create one at https://account.mapbox.com/

# Roadmap
I intend to update this project in the future to feature a location personal to myself as well as updating to the styles of the button.
